PART 1 – PROFESSIONAL SCENARIO

Scenario: Our team missed a deadline due to a misunderstanding about task roles. I was handling the frontend.

I felt frustrated but stayed calm and talked openly with my teammate. We discussed what went wrong and listened to each other.

I learned to clarify tasks early. Next time, I’ll confirm responsibilities at the start.

To improve, I suggest we do quick daily check-ins to avoid confusion.
