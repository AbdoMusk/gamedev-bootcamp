Assignment 1 — Game Production Schedule

Concept: 2D Platformer with 3 levels

Milestones & Deliverables:
1. First Playable
   - Player movement, Level 1 blockout, Basic UI, Collectibles, Simple enemy
2. Alpha Build
   - All levels blockout, Core mechanics, Art placeholders, Sound, Main menu
3. Beta Build
   - Final art, All levels complete, Polish, Bug fixes, Full audio

Work Breakdown Structure (First Playable):

Epic: Player Movement
- Implement walk/run/jump (8h)
- Add animations (6h)
- Tune controls (4h)

Epic: Level 1 Blockout
- Design layout (6h)
- Build in engine (8h)
- Place collectibles (4h)

Epic: Basic UI
- Main HUD (5h)
- Pause menu (4h)
- Score display (3h)

Dependencies & Critical Path:
- Animations depend on walk/run/jump code
- Controls tuning depends on basic movement
- Build in engine depends on layout design
- Place collectibles depends on level built
- Score display depends on collectibles placed

Critical Path: Walk/run/jump → Animations → Tune controls → Level layout → Build in engine → Place collectibles → Score display
