Assignment 1 - Critical Path Analysis and Time Estimation

Game: 2D Platformer

Milestones:
| Milestone        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| First Playable   | Basic gameplay loop |
| Alpha            | Core features complete |
| Beta             | All content, bug fixing |

Alpha Release Gates:
| Criteria                                 |
|------------------------------------------|
| Must run at 60 FPS for 1 hour on min spec |
| Zero A-class bugs                        |

Epic: Player Combat System
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
| Task                        | Ideal Hours |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Design combat mechanics     | 4           |
| Implement player attack     | 6           |
| Implement enemy AI          | 8           |
| Create hit detection        | 5           |
| Add health system           | 4           |
| Add animations              | 6           |
| Sound effects               | 3           |
| UI feedback                 | 3           |
| Playtesting                 | 4           |
| Bug fixing                  | 5           |

| Total Ideal Hours | 48      |
| Buffer (15%)     | 7.2     |
| Total w/ Buffer  | 55.2    |

Dependencies:
| Dependent Task         | Depends On         |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| Implement player attack| Design combat mech |
| Implement enemy AI     | Implement player atk|
| Create hit detection   | Implement player atk|
| Add health system      | Create hit detection|
| Add animations         | Implement player atk|
| Sound effects          | Add animations      |
| UI feedback            | Add animations      |
| Playtesting            | UI feedback         |
| Bug fixing             | Playtesting         |

Critical Path: Design combat mechanics → Implement player attack → Implement enemy AI → Create hit detection → Add health system → Add animations → UI feedback → Playtesting → Bug fixing
If "Bug fixing" is delayed, project deadline is pushed.
