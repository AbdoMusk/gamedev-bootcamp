Project Overview:

Atlas Runner: a PC platformer inspired by Moroccan landscapes, made in Godot in 3 weeks by a team of 2. Goal: create a fun, fast-paced game with Moroccan themes and simple controls.

Development Report:
Used Godot for development. Designed levels with tilemaps based on Moroccan regions. Started with basic movement, then added obstacles and collectibles like traditional artifacts. Used Trello for task tracking.

Problems Encountered:
- Player movement felt unresponsive
- Art assets didn't match Moroccan theme at first
- Deadline was tight, causing stress

Solutions / Adjustments:
- Tweaked physics for smoother controls
- Replaced art with Moroccan-inspired style
- Split tasks and focused on core features

Key Learning:
Test controls early and keep art style consistent with the theme. Focus on core gameplay first.
