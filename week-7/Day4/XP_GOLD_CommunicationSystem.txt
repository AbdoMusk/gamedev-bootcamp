Internal Communication & Feedback System

PART 1 – Diagnosis

Root causes:
1. Unclear decision-making: No central record, so teams don’t know who decided what. Leads to confusion and repeated questions.
2. Wrong channels: Important info sent in chat, gets lost. People miss updates, causing mistakes.
3. No feedback culture: Feedback is rare, only given when problems arise. Builds tension and resentment.
4. Emotional feedback: Feedback is personal, not focused on work. Hurts morale and trust.
5. Micromanagement: Managers check every detail, developers feel controlled. Designers feel ignored as their input is skipped.
Consequence: Teams are frustrated, work slows, and trust drops.

PART 2 – Communication Architecture

A. Channels:
1. Daily stand-up: Quick team sync, blockers shared. Used by all teams, every morning.
2. Weekly team meeting: Deeper discussion, planning. Used by each team, once a week.
3. Company-wide update: Email/newsletter, big decisions and news. All staff, every 2 weeks.
4. Async chat (Slack/Discord): Fast questions, updates. All staff, all day.
5. Decision log (Notion/Confluence): Records all key decisions. Managers update, all can read, updated as needed.

B. Rules & Protocols:
1. Use chat for quick questions, not for decisions.
2. All decisions must be logged in the decision log.
3. Meetings need agenda and summary notes.
4. Feedback is given in private, not public.
5. Async tools for non-urgent updates.
6. Response to chat within 4 hours during workday.
7. No micromanagement: managers review outcomes, not every step.
8. Designers must be included in feature discussions.

PART 3 – Feedback System

A. Types:
- Peer-to-peer: Private, regular check-ins.
- Manager-to-team: Monthly review, focus on goals.
- Team-to-manager: Quarterly survey, anonymous.

B. Method: SBI (Situation–Behavior–Impact)
- Chosen for clarity and focus on actions, not people.
- Example: "In yesterday’s meeting (Situation), you interrupted the designer (Behavior), which made them feel undervalued (Impact)."
- Applied in all feedback sessions, written or verbal.

C. Feedback Safety:
- All feedback is private unless agreed.
- Managers mediate conflicts.
- Toxic feedback is flagged, HR reviews.
- Training on giving/receiving feedback.

PART 4 – Crisis Simulation

Immediate action: Manager stops meeting, addresses issue privately with both parties.
Feedback reframed: "In the meeting, your comment about speed was public and personal. Next time, give feedback privately and focus on the work."
System failure: No rule against public criticism, no feedback training.
Rule change: All feedback must be private unless agreed by both.

PART 5 – Measurement & Improvement

1. Feedback frequency: Number of feedback sessions per month. Measured monthly. If low, schedule more.
2. Team satisfaction: Survey scores, quarterly. If low, hold focus groups.
3. Decision clarity: % of decisions logged. Measured monthly. If low, retrain managers.
4. Conflict rate: Number of reported conflicts. Measured monthly. If high, review protocols.
5. Meeting effectiveness: Survey after meetings. If low, improve agendas and summaries.
