Iteration & User Testing

Part 1: Playtesting & Observation

Prototype: Atlas Runner (PC platformer, Moroccan theme). Goal: reach the end of each level, collect artifacts, avoid obstacles.

Player Behavior Summary:
- Player 1: Hesitated at moving platforms, failed twice at spike traps, enjoyed collecting artifacts.
- Player 2: Confused by jump timing, engaged by level art, frustrated by enemy placement.

Key Observations:
- Players paused at unclear jump sections
- Missed some collectibles
- Both enjoyed Moroccan visuals
- Frustration at enemy positions

Main Problems:
- Jump timing unclear
- Enemy placement too difficult
- Some collectibles hard to find

Part 2: Metrics & Feedback Analysis

Metrics:
- Completion rate: 100% (both finished)
- Time to complete: Player 1 - 4 min, Player 2 - 5 min
- Failure rate: Player 1 - 3 deaths, Player 2 - 5 deaths
- Collectibles found: Player 1 - 7/10, Player 2 - 6/10

Interpretation:
- Both completed, but struggled with jumps and enemies
- Collectibles often missed
- Feedback matches metrics: frustration at hard sections, enjoyment of visuals

Part 3: Iteration & Improvement

Problem → Solution Table:
- Jump timing unclear → Add visual cues for jumps
- Enemy placement too hard → Move enemies, add safe zones
- Collectibles hard to find → Highlight collectibles

Implemented Changes:
- Added jump markers
- Moved some enemies to easier spots

Before/After:
- Before: Players failed jumps, frustrated by enemies
- After: Jumps clearer, less frustration

Next Iteration Plan:
- Test with 2 new players
- Track if deaths decrease and collectibles increase

Final Reflection:
- Surprised by how much visuals engaged players
- Jump sections changed the most
- With more time: add tutorial and more feedback prompts
