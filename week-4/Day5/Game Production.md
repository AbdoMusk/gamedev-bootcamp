Game Production Assignment

Game Idea: Medina Courier

1. Game Pipeline

Game Idea: Medina Courier is a simple 2D top-down game where you drive a scooter through Moroccan medina streets to deliver tea before time runs out.

Pre-production: I wrote down the main idea and what I want the game to feel like (busy, fun, a bit chaotic). I made a list of the main features (timer, obstacles, scooter movement) and drew a quick sketch of the level to test if the streets are wide enough.

Production: I need to make the player movement, a timer, some NPCs (like donkeys and tourists), and the art for the streets, scooter, and UI. I also need sounds for the market and the scooter.

Post-production: I will fix bugs, make the game run smoothly, and test it to make sure you can't get stuck. When it's ready, I will share it online.

Pipeline Table:
Pre-production -> Production -> Post-production
Plan and sketch -> Make game and art -> Test and release

2. Team Roles

Game Designer: Decides the rules and how the game works.
Programmer: Makes the game work (movement, timer, obstacles).
Artist: Draws the streets, scooter, and UI.
Sound Designer: Finds or makes sounds for the game.
QA Tester: Plays the game to find bugs and checks if it's fun.
Producer: Makes sure everyone is working and the game is finished on time.

Team Interaction:
Designer tells Programmer and Artist what to make. Programmer and Artist work together to put things in the game. Sound Designer gives sounds to Programmer. QA Tester tells Programmer about bugs. Producer checks on everyone.

3. Rapid Prototyping

Mechanic: Dodging obstacles (like donkeys).
I drew a street on paper and used coins as donkeys and a small eraser as the scooter. I moved the eraser and tried to avoid the coins while someone else put them in the way.
Feedback: My friend said it was too hard to dodge if the donkey appeared suddenly.
Reflection: I learned that players need a warning before obstacles show up. It's easier to test this on paper than in code.

4. Mini Game Design Document

Title: Medina Courier
Genre: Top-down arcade
Target: People who like simple, fast games
Core Loop: Pick up tea, drive to the destination, avoid obstacles, deliver tea, earn points, repeat.
Key Mechanics: Timer for hot tea, lose glasses if you crash, drifting gives a small speed boost.
Art Style: Simple, colorful, top-down 2D.

5. Post-Mortem Reflection

What went well: Focusing on one mechanic made the game feel good. The Moroccan theme made the art easy to plan.
Challenges: The scooter sometimes got stuck on corners. We spent a lot of time fixing this instead of adding new things.
How to improve: Test the level with simple shapes before making final art. Talk more with the team about level layout.
