Mini Game Production Project

Game Title: Medina Runner

---

1. High Concept Statement

Medina Runner is a 2D top-down arcade game where you play as a delivery person racing through the busy streets of a Moroccan medina to deliver mint tea before it gets cold. The game is for casual players who enjoy fast-paced, obstacle-dodging challenges.

2. Mini Game Design Document (GDD)

Core Mechanics:
- Move your character with arrow keys or swipe controls.
- Avoid obstacles like donkeys, tourists, and carts.
- Deliver tea before the timer runs out.
- Collect coins for upgrades.

Core Gameplay Loop:
1. Pick up tea at the café.
2. Navigate the medina, dodging obstacles.
3. Deliver tea to the customer before time runs out.
4. Earn coins and try for a higher score.

Simple Level/Environment Ideas:
- Narrow, winding streets with random obstacles.
- Different medina districts as levels (market, residential, plaza).

Key Assets:
- Visual: Player sprite, NPCs (donkey, tourist), street tiles, tea tray, coins, UI elements.
- Audio: Market background sounds, scooter/footsteps, collision sounds, delivery chime.

Basic Art Direction:
- Bright, warm colors (orange, blue, brown).
- Simple, cartoonish 2D sprites.

3. Pipeline Plan

Pre-production: Brainstorm idea, write GDD, sketch level, plan assets.
Production: Make player movement, obstacles, timer, art, and sounds.
Post-production: Test for bugs, polish visuals and audio, release game.

Roles and Responsibilities:
- Game Designer: Abdo (rules, GDD, level sketch)
- Programmer: Abdo (movement, timer, obstacles)
- Artist: Abdo (sprites, UI)
- Sound: Abdo (find/make sounds)
- QA: Abdo (testing)
- Producer: Abdo (planning, deadlines)

Pipeline Flow:
Pre-production -> Production -> Post-production
Plan -> Build -> Test & Release

4. Rapid Prototyping & Iteration

Prototype: I drew a map of a medina street on paper, used a coin as the player, and moved it through the path while a friend placed obstacles (erasers, pens) in the way.

Feedback: My friend said some turns were too tight and it was hard to avoid obstacles if they appeared suddenly.

Iteration Reflection: I made the streets a bit wider and added a rule that obstacles can't appear right in front of the player. This made the game feel more fair and fun.

5. Team Structure & Collaboration Simulation

Roles: I did all roles myself, but if I had a team, I would have a designer, programmer, artist, sound designer, QA, and producer.

Task Board Example:
- To Do: Write GDD, draw level, make player movement
- Doing: Draw sprites, code obstacles
- Done: Test prototype, collect feedback

Workflow: Designer plans, programmer and artist build, QA tests, producer checks progress. Everyone shares updates in a group chat.

6. Post-Mortem & Reflection

What went well: The core mechanic (dodging obstacles) was fun and easy to test on paper. The Moroccan theme made the art direction clear.

Biggest challenges: Making the level fair and not too hard. It was tricky to balance obstacle placement.

Most critical phase: Pre-production, because planning the level and rules early saved time later.

Team evaluation: Each role is important. Good communication would help avoid mistakes, like making art before the level is final.

Lessons learned: Next time, I would test more level layouts before drawing final art. For the next version, I would add power-ups like speed boosts or extra time.
