Team Communication & Collaboration

Communication Audit:
1. Designer added feature without informing devs. Problem: Causes bugs, delays. Solution: Announce changes before commit.
2. Tasks overlap, deadlines tight. Problem: Stress, confusion. Solution: Use task board, clarify priorities.
3. Feedback avoided. Problem: Issues not fixed, team stagnates. Solution: Set feedback rule, regular review.

Feedback Exercise:
Observation: Feature added without notice.
Impact: Caused bug, wasted dev time.
Suggestion: Inform team before adding features.
