Part 1 — Paper Prototype

Gameplay Diagram (top-down)

[START]
   ↓
[SAFE TILE] → [HAZARD] → [COIN]
                    ↓
                [CHECKPOINT]
                    ↓
                  [EXIT]

Rules:
- Hazard = lose 1 life
- Collect all coins → exit unlocks

Core Loop

Move → Obstacle → React (avoid) → Feedback (lose life / get coin) → Continue

Paper System
- Grid paper = level
- Coin tokens = collectibles
- Red markers = hazards
- One player token
